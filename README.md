Coconut oil is extracted from the kernel of matured coconuts harvested from the coconut palm and is high in saturated fats. Coconut oil is a common edible oil in certain countries, and there is a controversy regarding its effects on lipid profiles and cardiovascular disease risk. 
In Sri Lanka, most coconut oil manufacturers use mechanical machines with a mechanical tap system. They don’t have any oil-filling management systems embedded in their factories. Therefore, they cannot retrieve data and logs instantly. Because they have manual data-entering systems such as writing in books. The problem is being in this coconut oil manufacturing process that a substantial amount of oil is wasted when the filling process is carried out.
This system is developed to find a solution for above mentioned problem in the coconut oil manufacturing industry. This system will decrease the wastage of oil and makes the process more efficient than the traditional method uses in the industry.

Objectives
•	Create a coconut oil management system to reduce wastage and at the same time to reduce fraud while filling coconut oil cans for middle-range suppliers. 
•	Add several functions to the process of filling oil cans.
•	Add a data logger system using an online database and back up it in an offline database. 
•	Create Android Mobile Application. 
o	Users (Owners of the oil mills) will be able to view the data regarding the filling process.
o	Users can set a certain price per oil kilogram.
